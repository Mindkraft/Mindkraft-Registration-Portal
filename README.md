Oye JEBA,

I have uploaded register.php file along with its CSS ("register-styles.css") in the css folder and an image ("wide.jpg") in the img folder.. 

did a bit of coding for the front end of our registration page... Suggest any changes if you want. Image you can either continue to put the existing or can change it to something good. I just put something randomely in a haste.

Now we have to put a dynamic table below it to display all those who registered from that particular counter.

Matlab.. once you scan your details should be displayed in the table section.
SUNDAY the entire day i'll be in city. SO wont be doing any committing file in the repository. You if possible and if you get time work on the dynamic table. 

Also check the "Projects" tab when you get time. Have put up TODO list, In Process list, and Completed list which is currently empty now..
