Oye JEBA,

I have uploaded register.php file along with its CSS ("register-styles.css") in the css folder and an image ("wide.jpg") in the img folder.. 

did a bit of coding for the front end of our registration page... Suggest any changes if you want. Image you can either continue to put the existing or can change it to something good. I just put something randomely in a haste.
